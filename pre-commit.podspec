                    Automatically install a pre-commit hook from your working directory.

                    * Ensure that code is always linted and tested before checking it in.
                    * Save your pre-commit hook in .hooks/pre-commit
                    * Use the usual git operations, forget about that pesky Cmd-U, rake or xctool.
                    * When sharing code, new team members automatically get the pre-commit hooks.
